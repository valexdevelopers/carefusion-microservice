üî∑ Project Title: Hospital Management System API (Offline-First, Cloud-Synced Microservices)
üí° App Overview

This is a microservice-based hospital management API that functions both offline and online. When offline, it stores data locally, and when internet access is restored, it syncs all changes to the cloud for backup and central access. The system is designed for:

    Public health records management

    Hospital administration and operations

    Insurance management

    System administration

üìñ Feature Stories (User Stories)
1. Public Health Module

Story:
As a health official, I want to access anonymized public health data aggregated from hospitals, so I can track disease trends and resource needs across regions.

Includes:

    Syncs data from hospitals (e.g. cases, treatments)

    Exposes read-only endpoints for analytics

    Operates in compliance with privacy regulations

2. Admin Module

Story:
As a system administrator, I want to manage hospitals, users, and permissions so that I can control who has access to different sections of the system.

Includes:

    Admin login & authentication

    Manage hospital records and registration

    Assign roles (doctor, nurse, pharmacist, etc.)

    Monitor sync statuses of hospitals

3. Hospital Module

Story:
As a hospital staff member, I want to manage patients, appointments, prescriptions, inventory, and billing, so that I can deliver healthcare effectively both offline and online.

Includes:

    Offline-first capability with sync

    Patient intake and medical records

    Doctor‚Äôs appointments and schedules

    Prescriptions and pharmacy stock

    Billing and lab orders

4. Insurance Module

Story:
As an insurance company, I want to manage my own plans and pricing, and approve or reject patient claims submitted by hospitals, so I can ensure coverage and control fraud.

Includes:

    Insurance login and role-based access

    Update pricing and coverage terms

    View, approve, or reject patient claims

    Claim audit logs and history

5. Synchronization Service

Story:
As a mobile hospital unit working offline, I want the ability to continue using the app and automatically sync all data to the cloud once a connection is restored, so that nothing is lost and I stay up-to-date.

Includes:

    Local data persistence

    Retry mechanism for syncing

    Conflict resolution rules

    Sync logs and status tracking

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture Summary

    Backend Framework: (e.g., Node.js, Django, or Laravel)

    Data Sync Layer: Handles offline-to-online transitions

    Authentication: Role-based access control using JWT/OAuth

    Microservices: Separate services for user, hospital, insurance, and sync operations

    Database: Local (SQLite) + Cloud (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)

    Deployment Ready: Can be hosted on cloud or on-premise servers

üéØ Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates my ability to:

    Build scalable, resilient APIs

    Handle offline-first architecture

    Implement secure, multi-role access

    Design for real-world healthcare operations
